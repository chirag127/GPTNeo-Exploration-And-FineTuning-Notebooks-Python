# CI Workflow for GPTNeo Exploration and FineTuning Notebooks

name: CI Workflow

# Controls when the action will run.
# For now, trigger the workflow on push and pull request events for the main branch.
# Trigger on push to main, pull requests targeting main.
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This job builds and tests the Python project
  build_and_test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Set strategy for matrix build if needed (e.g., different Python versions)
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12", "3.13"]

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository into the workspace so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Set up Python environment with the specified version
      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}

          cache: 'pip'

      # Install dependencies using uv (modern Python package manager)
      # Assumes a pyproject.toml or requirements.txt is present for dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies with uv
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          # Install uv if not already available (usually managed by setup-python or pre-installed)
          # pip install uv
          uv pip install --system --upgrade
          uv pip install -r requirements.txt # Or pyproject.toml if using Poetry/PDM style dependencies
          uv pip install ipykernel # Needed for Jupyter notebooks

      # Run linters and formatters (Ruff) - FAST
      - name: Lint with Ruff
        run: |
          # Ensure Ruff is installed
          uv pip install ruff
          ruff check .

      # Run tests using Pytest
      # This step assumes your tests are in a 'tests/' directory and discoverable by pytest

      # Optional: Run Jupyter notebooks (e.g., using nbconvert for testing)
      # This is a more advanced step and might require careful setup
      # Example: Convert notebooks to tests or scripts
      # - name: Run Jupyter Notebooks
      #   run: |
      #     pip install nbconvert
      #     jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace notebooks/*.ipynb

      # Optional: Upload coverage reports if coverage is generated
      # - name: Upload coverage reports to Codecov
      #   uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      #   with:
      #     token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }} # Required for private repos
